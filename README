# Breast Cancer Classification Project 🧬
Deployed at: https://checkforbreastcancer.streamlit.app/
A machine learning project to classify whether a tumor is **Benign** or **Malignant** using real-world breast cancer data.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: `data.csv` from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.
- Features: 30 numeric measurements per tumor (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter).
- Target: `diagnosis` (B → 0: Benign, M → 1: Malignant)

## 🛠️ Workflow

1. 🧹 **Preprocessing**
   - Dropped irrelevant columns: `id`, `Unnamed: 32`
   - Label encoding: `diagnosis` converted from M/B to 1/0
   - Train-test split: 80% training, 20% testing
   - Standardized features using `StandardScaler`

2. 🤖 **Models Used**
   - **Logistic Regression**
   - **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** with linear kernel

3. 🔍 **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy on both training and testing sets
   - Custom input prediction support

4. 🧠 **Interactive Prediction**
   ```python
   Enter 30 feature values separated by space:


Predicts tumor type using both models:

🧠 Logistic Regression

🤖 SVM

🧪 Results

Model	Training Accuracy	Testing Accuracy
Logistic Regression	~99.5% ✅	~96.5% ✅
SVC (Linear Kernel)	~98.9% ✅	~98.2% ✅
💡 Notes
Feature scaling was crucial for model performance, especially for SVMs.

Both models showed very high accuracy, indicating effective separation of classes in feature space.

Dataset was clean and well-balanced, reducing preprocessing effort.

🔮 About the Predictive Input
The user can input 30 comma/space-separated values corresponding to all features. These are scaled and passed to both trained models, which return predictions.

📦 Deployment
This project is deployed using Streamlit for an interactive web interface. You can enter the 30 features, and the model will predict whether the tumor is Benign or Malignant.
